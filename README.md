  # swaps.so - 🐇
</h1>
<p>
Swaps.so is a simple to use interface for token swaps on the Solana blockchain. Simply hop from one token to the next with guided or traditional UI's for token swapping. Swaps leverages the power of the Jupiter API for maximum liquidity efficiency and absolutely minimal slippage.

<p>
Jupiter leverages the power of smart routing between the most efficient liquidity providers on the Solana Blockchain. Each and every swap is routed through single or multiple routes to achieve the most beneficial outcome for the Swapper. These routes are known as Multi Hop Routes and are the inspiration for the Rabbit Logo.

<h3>
> BUIDL Thesis
</h3>
<p>
A good percentage of swap focused dApps are built for crypto native users and fail to abstract a majority of the complexity and overwhelming statistics away. Swaps is designed purely around User Experience and guiding them through this process as efficiently as possible. Swaps is introducing 'Guided Swaps' whereby the user is not explicity choosing the tokens from a modal like interface (see Uniswap) but rather expressing the tokens in which they want to swap in a step by step process. Traditional swap interface will also be run along side this. 
  
> ℹ️ **TLDR:** Were building swaps for users who dont care for overwhelming lists and statistics but wish to swap and be done. ⚡
